![Ami with a book](./images/amiBook.jpg)

The goal of this site is to simplify some procedures I've seen online so you can personalize your ereader. I think in an era where tech companies want us overly dependent on their (usually $$$, subscription-based) solutions, learning how to DIY your device into something that oozes your personality is really empowering... and not in the stupid tech world way. I think tech companies make money off us when we don't understand how our devices work and now more than ever I believe we need to be more proactive with tinkering with our devices. ♡

## My Kobo set up

I've been reading more than I have in years thanks to my ereader. I've also caught the DIY, hacking bug. Here's what my current set up looks like with KOReader (and some other plugins):

I've used:

* NickelMenu to launch KOReader
* ProjectTitle plugin
* A plugin that lets me use my Nintendo Switch joycon as a page turner
* A few patches I've experimented with
* Custom fonts
* Custom screensavers for the default Kobo device and KOReader
* Custom icons for every menu item

In the past I've had Wallabag, Rakuyomi, and some other plugins. I don't use those right now, but I have gotten them to work. 

## Who this site is for

This site is intended for nontechnical audiences, though I hope the documentation can assist users at all levels. I've noticed a lot of confusion with certain tasks that I believe I can simplify with some good old fashioned, non-AI generated docs. I'm a technical writer by trade, so this is right up my alley.

I've tried to cite my sources when possible and I'll try my best to maintain the docs so they're up to date. Really, I want ereader hacking to be as accessible as possible, which means sometimes explaining concepts, making suggestions, or writing in a relatively verbose way that a developer might not need. 

If my procedures or concepts aren't clear, please let me know by [filing a GitHub issue](https://github.com/littlepriests/kobo-beginner/issues).  If you don't know what that means, then you will soon. ♡♡♡♡
